# 🧠 Smart Waste Classification Using CNN

## 📌 Introduction

Efficient waste sorting plays a crucial role in environmental protection. However, many people still struggle to correctly identify how to dispose of different types of garbage. This project proposes a simple and intelligent web-based solution that uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for **image-based waste classification**.

By uploading a photo of an item, users will receive:

- 🗂️ The correct waste category:
  - Recyclable waste
  - Kitchen waste
  - Hazardous materials
  - Other waste
- ♻️ Simple advice on how to dispose of the item properly

The goal is to make waste sorting easier for the general public through modern AI technology.
